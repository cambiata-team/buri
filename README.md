# Buri

## Install

The fastest way to install the Buri toolchain is to run the following command:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/cambiata-team/buri-go/raw/main/install.sh | sudo sh
```

Also use the above installation command to update the toolchain. There are plans to improve this process in the future.
